# Solidity API

# SharedValidation

Optimized shared library containing common validation functions using enhanced custom errors

This library is designed to reduce contract size by centralizing common validation logic
and using gas-efficient custom errors instead of string constants. This approach provides
significant gas savings and contract size reduction while maintaining clear error context.

Features:
- Enhanced custom errors with contextual parameters
- Address validation functions
- Time and deadline validation
- Signature validation utilities
- Permission and authorization checks
- Operation type validation
- Gas and transaction validation

This library follows the security rules defined in .cursorrules and implements
the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern where applicable.

Gas Optimization Benefits:
- ~50% gas reduction compared to string-based errors
- Significant contract size reduction
- Enhanced error context with parameters
- Modern Solidity best practices (0.8.4+)
