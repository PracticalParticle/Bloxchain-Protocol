# StateAbstraction

A library for implementing secure state abstraction with time-locks and meta-transactions

This library provides a comprehensive framework for creating secure operations that require
state management and multiple phases of approval before execution. It supports:

- Time-locked operations that can only be executed after a waiting period
- Meta-transactions for delegated approvals
- Role-based access control for different operation types
- Multiple execution types (standard function calls or raw transaction data)
- Payment handling for both native tokens and ERC20 tokens
- State machine-driven operation workflows

The library uses StateAbstractionDefinitions for modular configuration,
allowing easy customization of operation types, function schemas, and role permissions
without modifying the core library code.

The library is designed to be used as a building block for secure smart contract systems
that require high levels of security and flexibility through state abstraction.
