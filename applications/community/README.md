## Fork-First Development Process

We recommend developing applications in your own fork first:

### Phase 1: Fork Development
1. **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account
2. **Develop your application** in your fork
3. **Maintain long-term** in your fork
4. **Iterate and improve** based on real-world usage

### Phase 2: Maturity & Validation
1. **Real-world usage** - Deploy and use in production
2. **Community feedback** - Gather user feedback and bug reports
3. **Security audits** - Complete professional audits
4. **Documentation** - Comprehensive docs and examples
5. **Testing** - Extensive test coverage and validation

### Phase 3: Official Integration
1. **Only when truly ready** - Production-ready applications only
2. **Submit PR** to official repository
3. **Include audit reports** and documentation
4. **Demonstrate real-world usage** and success
