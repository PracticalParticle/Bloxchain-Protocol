# Guardian Framework Architecture

## Overview

The Guardian Framework is a unique blockchain security framework built around a **state machine architecture** that provides comprehensive security, access control, and transaction management capabilities. Unlike traditional smart contract patterns, Guardian uses a centralized state management system called `SecureOperationState` that acts as the core engine for all security operations.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. State Machine Pattern
Guardian implements a **centralized state machine** where all security operations, access control, and transaction management flow through a single, well-defined state engine (`SecureOperationState`).

### 2. Unified Security Model
All Guardian contracts inherit from a common security foundation that provides:
- **Multi-phase transaction processing**
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**
- **Time-locked operations**
- **Meta-transaction support**
- **Event forwarding**

### 3. Modular Design
The framework is built with modularity in mind:
- **Core libraries** provide foundational security
- **Definition libraries** standardize operation types and schemas
- **Contract implementations** inherit and extend core functionality

## SecureOperationState: The Core Engine

The `SecureOperationState` struct is the heart of the Guardian framework, acting as a comprehensive state machine that manages all aspects of secure operations.

### State Machine Components

```solidity
struct SecureOperationState {
    // ============ SYSTEM STATE ============
    bool initialized;
    uint256 txCounter;
    uint256 timeLockPeriodSec;
    
    // ============ TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT ============
    mapping(uint256 => TxRecord) txRecords;
    EnumerableSet.UintSet pendingTransactionsSet;
    
    // ============ ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL ============
    mapping(bytes32 => Role) roles;
    EnumerableSet.Bytes32Set supportedRolesSet;
    
    // ============ FUNCTION MANAGEMENT ============
    mapping(bytes4 => FunctionSchema) functions;
    EnumerableSet.Bytes32Set supportedFunctionsSet;
    
    // ============ OPERATION TYPES ============
    mapping(bytes32 => ReadableOperationType) supportedOperationTypes;
    EnumerableSet.Bytes32Set supportedOperationTypesSet;
    
    // ============ META-TRANSACTION SUPPORT ============
    mapping(address => uint256) signerNonces;
    
    // ============ EVENT FORWARDING ============
    address eventForwarder;
}
```

### State Machine Responsibilities

#### 1. **Transaction Lifecycle Management**
- **Request Phase**: Transactions are submitted and validated
- **Pending Phase**: Time-locked transactions wait for approval
- **Approval Phase**: Authorized users can approve pending transactions
- **Execution Phase**: Approved transactions are executed
- **Completion Phase**: Transaction results are recorded and events emitted

#### 2. **Role-Based Access Control**
- **Role Definition**: Define custom roles with specific permissions
- **Permission Management**: Grant/revoke permissions for functions and operations
- **Dynamic Role Assignment**: Roles can be modified during contract lifecycle
- **Hierarchical Permissions**: Support for role hierarchies and inheritance

#### 3. **Operation Type Management**
- **Standardized Operations**: Pre-defined operation types (OWNERSHIP_TRANSFER, BROADCASTER_UPDATE, etc.)
- **Custom Operations**: Support for custom operation types
- **Operation Validation**: Ensure operations follow defined schemas
- **Workflow Generation**: Automatically generate valid operation workflows

#### 4. **Time-Lock Security**
- **Configurable Time Locks**: Set different time-lock periods for different operations
- **Multi-Phase Operations**: Support for operations requiring multiple phases
- **Emergency Overrides**: Built-in mechanisms for emergency situations
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all time-locked operations

## Architecture Layers

### Layer 1: Core Libraries
**Purpose**: Provide foundational security and state management

- **`StateAbstraction.sol`**: Core state machine implementation
- **`SharedValidation.sol`**: Common validation functions
- **`BaseDefinitionLoader.sol`**: Base functionality for definition loading

### Layer 2: Definition Libraries
**Purpose**: Standardize operation types, function schemas, and role permissions

- **`SecureOwnableDefinitions.sol`**: Standard definitions for ownership operations
- **`DynamicRBACDefinitions.sol`**: Standard definitions for RBAC operations
- **`StateAbstractionDefinitions.sol`**: Standard definitions for multi-phase operations

### Layer 3: Contract Implementations
**Purpose**: Provide ready-to-use contract implementations

- **`SecureOwnable.sol`**: Basic ownership with Guardian security
- **`DynamicRBAC.sol`**: Role-based access control with Guardian security
- **`GuardianAccountAbstraction.sol`**: Account abstraction with Guardian security
- **`GuardianAccountAbstractionWithRoles.sol`**: Account abstraction with RBAC

### Layer 4: Application Contracts
**Purpose**: DApp-specific implementations using Guardian security

- **`SimpleVault.sol`**: Example vault implementation
- **`SimpleRWA20.sol`**: Example RWA token implementation

## State Machine Flow

### 1. Initialization Phase
```
Contract Deployment → State Machine Initialization → Role Setup → Operation Type Configuration
```

### 2. Operation Request Phase
```
User Request → Validation → State Machine Check → Transaction Record Creation → Time Lock Application
```

### 3. Approval Phase
```
Time Lock Expiry → Authorization Check → State Machine Validation → Transaction Approval → Execution Preparation
```

### 4. Execution Phase
```
Approved Transaction → State Machine Execution → Function Call → State Update → Event Emission
```

## Key Benefits of State Machine Architecture

## Integration with TypeScript SDK

The TypeScript SDK provides comprehensive interfaces to interact with Guardian contracts:

### **SecureOwnable Integration**
```typescript
import { SecureOwnable } from '@guardian/sdk'

const secureOwnable = new SecureOwnable(client, walletClient, contractAddress, chain)

// Access ownership information
const owner = await secureOwnable.owner()
const broadcaster = await secureOwnable.getBroadcaster()
const recovery = await secureOwnable.getRecovery()
```

### **DynamicRBAC Integration**
```typescript
import { DynamicRBAC } from '@guardian/sdk'

const dynamicRBAC = new DynamicRBAC(client, walletClient, contractAddress, chain)

// Access role information
const roles = await dynamicRBAC.getAllRoles()
const roleInfo = await dynamicRBAC.getRoleInfo(roleHash)
const hasRole = await dynamicRBAC.hasRole(roleHash, walletAddress)
```
