 * - Workflow type information and timing

 * ```typescript
 * const workflow = new Workflow(

 *   '0x1234...',
 *   chain
 * );
 * 
 * // Get all operation workflows
 * const workflows = await workflow.getOperationWorkflows();
 * 
 * // Get workflow for specific operation
 * const workflow = await workflow.getWorkflowForOperation('0xabcd...');
