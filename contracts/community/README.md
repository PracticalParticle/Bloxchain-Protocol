# Community Contributions

This directory is for **community-contributed** contracts and components that build on Bloxchain Protocol.

## Status

- Code in this directory is **not audited** by the Bloxchain maintainers.
- There are **no stability or backward-compatibility guarantees**.
- Use at your own risk. Always review and audit any code before using it with real assets.

## Scope

- Blox implementations, adapters, and integrations
- Components that extend or compose with official `core/` and `components/` contracts
- Experimental or niche use cases that are maintained by the community

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome via pull request. Maintainers will review for obvious issues and alignment with the protocol, but the bar differs from `core/` and official `components/`. See the main repository CONTRIBUTING guide (if present) and open an issue first for larger changes.

## Relationship to the rest of the repo

- **core/** – Engine and account abstraction; maintained with strict review.
- **standards/** – Protocol-level behavior and hook interfaces.
- **components/** – Official components built on core.
- **community/** – This directory; community-maintained, separate from the above.
